<p align="center">
    <img src="Artwork/header.png" width="890" alt="Tabman"/>
</p>

## Features
- [x] Super easy to implement page view controller with indicator bar.
- [x] Multiple indicator bar styles.
- [x] Simplistic, yet highly extensive customisation.
- [x] Full support for custom components.
- [x] Built on a powerful and informative page view controller, [Pageboy](https://github.com/uias/pageboy).

## Requirements
Tabman requires iOS 9, Swift 4 and uses [Pageboy 2](https://github.com/uias/Pageboy/releases/tag/2.0.0).

For details on using older versions of Tabman or Swift please see [Compatibility](Docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Installation
### CocoaPods
Tabman is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Tabman', '~> 1.0'
```

And run `pod install`.

### Carthage
Tabman is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Simply install carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Add Tabman to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "uias/Tabman" ~> 1.0
```

**Dependencies**

- [Pageboy](https://www.github.com/msaps/Pageboy) by Merrick Sapsford
- [PureLayout](https://www.github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout) by PureLayout

### Example
An example project is available to take a look at some of the features that **Tabman** offers. To run the example, simply clone the repo, run 

```ogdl
carthage bootstrap --platform ios
```

and build the workspace.


## Usage

### The Basics

1) Create an instance of `TabmanViewController` and provide it with a `PageboyViewControllerDataSource`, also configuring the items you want to display in the `TabmanBar`. Note: `TabmanViewController` conforms to and is set as the `PageboyViewControllerDelegate`.

```swift
class YourTabViewController: TabmanViewController, PageboyViewControllerDataSource {

	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()

		self.dataSource = self

        	// configure the bar
        	self.bar.items = [Item(title: "Page 1"),
                          	  Item(title: "Page 2")]
	}
}
```

2) Implement `PageboyViewControllerDataSource`.

```swift
func numberOfViewControllers(in pageboyViewController: PageboyViewController) -> Int {
    return viewControllers.count
}
    
func viewController(for pageboyViewController: PageboyViewController,
                    at index: PageboyViewController.PageIndex) -> UIViewController? {
    return viewControllers[index]
}
    
func defaultPage(for pageboyViewController: PageboyViewController) -> PageboyViewController.Page? {
    return nil
}
```

3) All done! ðŸŽ‰

### Page View Controller
As Tabman is based on **[Pageboy](https://github.com/uias/Pageboy)**, all the extras and niceities in a `PageboyViewController` are available in a`TabmanViewController`. Including:

- Simplified data source management.
- Enhanced delegation; featuring exact relative positional data and reliable updates.
- Infinite scrolling support.
- Automatic timer-based page transitioning.
- Support for custom page transitions.

Read up on the **Pageboy** documentation [here](https://github.com/uias/Pageboy#usage).

### Child Content Insetting
Tabman will automatically attempt to inset any `UIScrollView` that if finds within it's child view controllers. This is enabled by default:

```swift
.automaticallyAdjustsChildScrollViewInsets = true
```

*The values used for insetting the child content are also available for manual use at `bar.requiredInsets`. Additionally, `additionalSafeAreaInsets` are also configured to allow for content to be pinned to the safe areas when running iOS 11.*

Automatic insetting support is available for any `UIScrollView` derived class such as `UITableView` and also view controllers such as `UITableViewController` and `UICollectionViewController`.

**Troubleshooting** - If you are having issues with the automatic insetting behaviour of Tabman, please check out the [Automatic Insetting Troubleshooting Guide](Docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#automatic-insetting). If you still are having issues, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/uias/Tabman/issues/new).

## Customization
The `TabmanBar` in Tabman can be completely customized to your liking, by simply modifying the available properties in the `.bar` `TabmanBar.Config` object.

#### Style
The style of bar to display, by default this is set to `.scrollingButtonBar`.

```swift
tabViewController.bar.style = .buttonBar
```

##### Available Styles:

</p>

*For examples on implementing real-world bar styles with `Tabman`, check out [Tabman-Styles](https://github.com/uias/Tabman-Styles).*

#### Location
Choose where you want the bar to appear, by default this is set to `.preferred` which will use the predefined preferred location for the active style.

```swift
tabViewController.bar.location = .top
```

*Note: The bar will automatically take `UIKit` components such as `UINavigationBar` and `UITabBar` into account.*

#### Appearance
Customization of the appearance and styling of a bar is available via `.appearance`. Providing a `TabmanBar.Appearance` object with your desired configuration will instantly update the appearance of the active bar:

```swift
tabViewController.bar.appearance = TabmanBar.Appearance({ (appearance) in

	// customise appearance here
	appearance.text.color = UIColor.red
	appearance.indicator.isProgressive = true
})
```

*The full list of appearance properties can be found [here](Docs/APPEARANCE.md).*

*For more advanced customisation, including defining your own indicator and bar styles please read [here](Docs/ADVANCED_CUSTOMISATION.md).*

#### Behaviors
You can also enable different behaviors via `.behaviors`. Simply provide an array of your desired `TabmanBar.Behavior` values and the bar will start using them:

```swift
tabViewController.bar.behaviors = [.autoHide(.always)]
```

*The full list of available behaviors can be found [here](Docs/BEHAVIORS.md).*
