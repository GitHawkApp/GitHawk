Highlightr is an iOS & macOS syntax highlighter built with Swift. It uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) as it core, supports [169 languages and comes with 77 styles](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).

Takes your lame string with code and returns a NSAttributtedString with proper syntax highlighting.

## Usage
Highlightr provides two main classes:

### Highlightr
This is the main endpoint, you can use it to convert code strings into NSAttributted strings.
```Swift
	let highlightr = Highlightr()
	highlightr.setTheme(to: "paraiso-dark")
	let code = "let a = 1"
	// You can omit the second parameter to use automatic language detection.
	let highlightedCode = highlightr.highlight(code, as: "swift") 
	
```
### CodeAttributedString
A sublcass of NSTextStorage, you can use it to highlight text on real time.
```Swift
	let textStorage = CodeAttributedString()
	textStorage.language = "Swift"
	let layoutManager = NSLayoutManager()
	textStorage.addLayoutManager(layoutManager)

	let textContainer = NSTextContainer(size: view.bounds.size)
	layoutManager.addTextContainer(textContainer)

	let textView = UITextView(frame: yourFrame, textContainer: textContainer)
```

## JavaScript?

Yes, Highlightr relies on iOS & macOS [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Carbon/Reference/WebKit_JavaScriptCore_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004754) to parse the code using highlight.js. This is actually quite fast!

## Performance

It will never be as fast as a native solution, but it's fast enough to be used on a real time editor.

It comes with a custom made HTML parser for creating NSAttributtedStrings, is pre-processing the themes and is preloading the JS libraries. As result it's taking around of 50 ms on my iPhone 6s for processing 500 lines of code.
