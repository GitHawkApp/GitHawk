   Allows your component to render to an array of child components.

   This is the workhorse of React implementations. Ideally, your components just transform data in render() based on
   state and props, and then map to other components for view configuration, etc.

   NOTE: This can be called on any thread. This function must remain pure, or you will cause crashes.

   NOTE: Memoization is done by the framework automatically if your props are equatable, so instead of caching values
         in render, always prefer to implement equatable on your PropType, and leave it to the framework.

   Allows components to specify how their children should be positioned relative to eachother. It's rare to need to
   do this, since generally you should just return a FlexboxComponent from render() to handle layout for you.

   @param constraint: The range of sizes that is allowed for your layout. NaN in any axis means unconstrained.
   @param tree: The result of the render() pass on every level of the component hierarchy. This gives you access to
                the children you created in render().

   Mount: Attach your component to a view hierarchy.

   The normal algorithm can be found in StandardMountLayout().

   In general, you should not override these methods unless you're doing something really advanced. Instead, override
   the componentWillMount and related methods.

   @param parentView: The view you're mounting in. Not necessarily the view associated with your direct parent component
                      since not all components have views.
   @param layout: The layout object returned by your component in layout().
   @param position: The origin within the parentView's coordinate space for where you should render your component.

   @return A MountContext object, which provides the input parameters that should be used for your children. If you
           want your children to mount into a view you created, you should use that view for the mount context, and
           update the position for children to be within that view's coordinate space.
