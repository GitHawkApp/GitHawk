/**
 An internal map that maintains the list of Theodolite-managed views for any given view.
 
 There is one view pool map associated with every Theodolite view when a child mounts into that view. The view pool
 maps are generated lazily.
 
 View pool maps internally store a hash map of view configurations to view pools. By keying on view configurations,
 we ensure that if we hit a view pool, all views can be reconfigured for the component that's asking for a view.
