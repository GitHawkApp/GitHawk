/*
To use this program, compile it -- if you can -- and then type something like:

chan -n 5000 -d 2 < input.txt

In this case, it will produce 5000 words of output, checking two-word groups.
(The explanation above describes two-word generation. If you type "-d 3",
the program will find three-word groups, and so on. Greater depths make more
sense, but they require more input text and take more time to process.)
