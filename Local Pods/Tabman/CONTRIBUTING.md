## Code of conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please read it before making any contributions.

## Setting up the project for development

Tabman relies on a couple of dependencies, `Pageboy` and `PureLayout`. To integrate these dependencies correctly for developing for Tabman you need to do the following:

- Ensure you have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed. If not, install via Homebrew with `brew install carthage`. 
- Fork / Clone the `Tabman` repository. 
- Run `carthage bootstrap --plaftorm ios`.
- Open `Tabman.xcworkspace` in Xcode and off you go!

The `Tabman-Example` project is useful for manually testing `Tabman`, featuring positional debugging labels and visual cues for ensuring everything is running smoothly. It also provides a good platform for testing dynamically updating the appearance and style responsiveness of any updates. 😁

## Testing

### Running tests

Tests should be added for all functionality, both when adding new behaviors to existing features, and implementing new ones.

Pageboy uses `XCTest` to run its tests, which can either be run through Xcode or by running `$ swift test` in the repository.

## Questions or discussions

If you have a question about the inner workings of Tabman, or if you want to discuss a new feature - feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/uias/Tabman/issues/new).

Happy contributing! 👨🏻‍💻
