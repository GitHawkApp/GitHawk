# Getting Started With GitHawk
First off, welcome to the GitHawk community!

This guide will walk through the setup process required in order to get the GitHawk app running properly.

## 1. Cloning the repo
1. Create or navigation to a folder/directory where you’ll store the GitHawk project.

	Example: `mkdir ./desktop/GitHawkApp/`

2. In terminal clone the repo using: `git clone https://github.com/<YourGithubName>/GitHawk.git`

## 2. Installing 

```
cd GitHawk
bundle
bundle exec pod install
npm install
```

## 3. Setting up code-signing (With automatic code-signing)

1. Open the Xcode workspace called: `Freetime.xcworkspace`
(`open Freetime.xcworkspace`)


	**Setting up bundle and group ID’s**
	- - - -

2. Open the projects settings  ![](./Design/projectIcon.png). 
On the left there under Targets should be:

	* Freetime
	* FreetimeTests
	* FreetimeWatch
	* FreetimeWatch Extension

3. Under each of these targets make sure your in the _General_ tab. **Change the team** to the team associated with your Apple Developer Account and switch the bundle ID’s like so:
	
	**Freetime**: *com.xxxx.freetime* ➡️
	*com.`<yourRegularBundleName>`.freetime*
	
	**FreetimeWatch**: *com.xxxx.freetime.watchkitapp* ➡️
	*com.`<yourRegularBundleName>`.freetime.watchkitapp*
	
	**FreetimeWatch Extension**: *com.xxxx.freetime.watchkitapp.watchkitextension* ➡️ *com.`<yourRegularBundleName>`.freetime.watchkitapp.watchkitextension*

4. Under the _Capabilities_ tab change the App Group ID’s like so (Does not apply to FreetimeTests):

	1.  Remove *group.com.xxxx.freetime*
	2.  Create new group ID (Click plus in the bottom left) and name it *group.com.`<yourRegularBundleName>`.freetime*

	> *Note: All group ID’s must be the same (This is what groups them!)*
	
	> Checkpoint: All errors should have disappeared (You should still not be able to build successfully though)


**Setting up plists**
- - - -

4. In the projects navigation panel open the folder named FreetimeWatch.

1.  Open the `info.plist`
2.  Change `WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier` from *com.xxxx.freetime* ➡️ the Freetime Target Bundle ID (*com.`<yourRegularBundleName>`.freetime*)
5. Back in the projects navigation panel open the folder FreetimeWatch Extension
1.  Open `info.plist`
2.  Expand `NSExtension` > `NSExtensionAttributes`
4.  Change `WKAppBundleIdentifier` from *com.xxxx.freetime.watchkitapp* ➡️ the FreetimeWatch Target Bundle ID (*com.`<yourRegularBundleName>`.freetime.watchkitapp*)

>   Checkpoint: At this point you should be able to successfully build the app (But not able to sign in)


## 4. Setting up OAuth for login

To be able to log in during development, you'll need a Client ID and Client Secret.
To get these, [register](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) a new OAuth application on GitHub.

### Registering

Here, you will need to fill in an Application name, Homepage URL and Authorization callback URL.
Make sure the Authorization callback URL is set to `freetime://`. The others can be filled in as you wish.

You'll be redirected to the application page where you can access your Client ID and Client Secret.

To add the Client ID and Client Secret to the App, follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, go to `Product` (in the Menu bar) > `Scheme` > `Manage Schemes...`
2. Select `Freetime-AppCenter` and click `Edit...`
3. Go to `Run` > `Arguments`
4. Add your Client ID (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` as key) and Client Secret (`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`) to the Environment Variables.


Build and Code away!
