# Freetime

_A GitHub manager app to use in your freetime._

## What

Freetime is a small iOS app that makes managing GitHub accounts and projects a little easier. It exists because GitHub's mobile interface is missing features and slow.

It is also test and proof that you can build fairly complicated apps with [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) in Swift.

## Why

- Push `IGListKit` + Swift to its limits
- Enable project management on mobile
- Explore [GitHub's GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/)
- Scratch my Swift itch
- Create a real, complex app in the open

## How

Freetime will be released with (at least) a three-phased rollout:

1. Basic, "read only" version.
    - Read notifications for PRs and Issues
    - React to comments
    - Mark notifications as read
2. Add replies to PRs and Issues
    - Close, lock, and re-open PRs and Issues
    - Label PRs and Issues
3. Repo management
    - Browse & create Issues
    - Browse PRs
    - Create & delete labels
4. Northstar
    - Browse PR content
    - Accept, reject, and merge PRs
    - :rocket:

## Contributing

:warning: This repo is moving _fast_! :warning:

I'm happy to take PRs, but I'm working off of `master` at the moment, and your PR might go stale quick. Be warned!

Once this is released and development slows down I might get more formal about our work. Until then, its the wild, wild west.
